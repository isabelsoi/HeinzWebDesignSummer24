        <h3> How a broswer Views a Webpage </h3>
        <p> A browser fetches and displays data from a webpage by 
            making 1 or more HTTP requests to the server for the 
            files needed to display the page and the server 
            responds with the requested files and if you visit 
            another the browser requests the new files and the 
            server responds with them.
            The significance of HTML in web development is to 
            provide the backbone and structure of a web page, 
            defining the layout and orangiztaion of content on a 
            web page by using a ranked structure of elements.
            The use of hyperlinks and Uniform Resources Locators
            (URLs) in navigating between pages allows users to 
            navigate from one page to another.
