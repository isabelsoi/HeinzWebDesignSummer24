        <h3> How a broswer Views a Webpage </h3>
        <p> A browser fetches and displays data from a webpage by
            making 1 or more HTTP requests to the server for the
            files needed to display the page and the server
            responds with the requested files and if you visit
            another the browser requests the new files and the
            server responds with them.
            The significance of HTML in web development is to
            provide the backbone and structure of a web page,
            defining the layout and orangiztaion of content on a
            web page by using a ranked structure of elements.
            The use of hyperlinks and Uniform Resources Locators
            (URLs) in navigating between pages allows users to
            navigate from one page to another.
