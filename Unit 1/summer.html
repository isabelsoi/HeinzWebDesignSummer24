<h1>Summer Vaction</h1>

<h3> Day 1 </h3>

<p> <!--Paragraph 1-->
    During my summer vaction so far i have gone to Disney
    World in Flordia to celebrate my older sister's graduation.
    After flying there, went to the hotel we were staying at ,the
    Boardwalk, and dropped off our luggaged and met up with my
    Abuelita and Papa Roger. Afterwards we had walked to Epcot
    and "walked around the countries" and ate food at some of 
    the food stalls, which i then went onto the disney app and 
    loaded up the scavanger hunt adventure that went across the 
    park. After completeing 3/8 of the scavanger hunt we went to
    diner at the coral reef restaurant. After we had eaten at the 
    restaurant, we continued to just walk around for a bit. Until 
    we went shopping, which after a while my Abuelita and Papa Roger 
    had to leave. After we were done shopping we stayed for a bit 
    longer and then left the park, going back to the hotel for 
    the rest of the day.

   On the third day we woke up a bit later than we wanted to so we 
   had to rush getting ready. After we left the hotel we took one 
   of the busses to the Animal kingdom. So we could meet up with 
   Abuelita and Papa Roger. After we meet up with them we walked 
   around the park, rode some of the rides. Afterwards we grabbed 
   some snacks for lunch and walked around some more. The the group 
   split into 2, so my sister and dad could go ride the rollercoaster.
   While the rest of us watched an animal show. Then we met back up 
   and went to diner at one of the restuants. Afterwords we went to 
   a show based off the Lion King. Afterwords we walked around for 
   a bit and then left for the day ,returning to the hotel.
