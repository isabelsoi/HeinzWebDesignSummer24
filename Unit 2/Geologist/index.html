        <h2> Geology falls in the sciences of natural science </h2>

        <p>
            With geology we have learned many secrets of the past
            which we probably wouldn't have learn otherwise. Those
            secrets include our history as humans and even from
            before human time. They can show us so much about
            history and I want to help discover more of it.
