                        Hammerhead sharks belong to the genus
                        Sphyrna which are characterized by a
                        flattened hammer or shovel-shaped head, or
                        cephalofoil. They are also apart of the
                        Sphyrnidae family Hammerhead sharks, or
                        sphyrnids, are perhaps the most distinctive
                        and unique of all sharks.

                        Five out of the nine species of hammerhead
                        sharks are endangered. The scalloped
                        hammerhead, the great hammerhead, the
                        smalleye hammerhead, the scalloped bonnethead,
                        and the scoophead shark. It's unknown how
                        many of these hammerheads are left in the
                        world today. The scalloped and great
                        hammerheads are found around the world, while
                        the smalleye hammerhead's range is restricted
                        to the coastal waters of South America. The
                        scalloped bonnethead lives on the western
                        coast of Mexico, Central America, Colombia,
                        Ecuador, and Peru. The scoophead shark has a
                        wider range around Mexico, Central America,
                        and South America.
